=head1 NAME

DefEnv

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reads a local file def.env and set the local variables if any are defined

=FUNCTIONS

=head3 read([$file])

Reads the variable in file $file (default value is "env.def") in the format:

VAR1=blabla
VAR2=moreblabla+
PERLLIB=ici:ailleurs

If the name of a variable matches PERL5?LIB, then all the values (separated by :) are pushed into @INC.

If the value ends with + (VAR2 above) then the value is appended (separated) to the current value of the variable; VAR2 would become VAR2:moreblabla.
